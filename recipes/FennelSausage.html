        <h1>Fennel Sausage Rigatoni Pasta</h1>
        <img src="Rigatoni.jpeg">
        <p>This is the big one. I cant take any credit for this as I discovered this one at my
            dear friend Lauras 30th birthday. Her good friend from South Africa (her home) made This
            plate of fennelly spicy sausagy goodness for us and my life hasnt been the same since.
            The sweetness of the fenel, richness from the cream and sausage and tang from the tomato and 
            chilli flakes work to create the ultimate dinner time comfort food.

                 until sauce thickens.
