        <h1>Peanut Chicken Noodles</h1>
        <img src="noodles_image.png">
        <p>Next up is one of my favourite recipes, Chicken and bok choi noodles complimented with
            a tangy home made peanut sauce.
        </p>
        <p>This is a recipe of my own which is loosely based around a dish that my good friend jack made one time before training.
            He showed me a picture of his creation and I couldnt resist having a go myself. The dish has now become a staple in my
            weekday dinner rotation! It comes with high reviews from anyone I have served it to, so im sure you will enjoy it just as much!
